### Frequently Asked Questions

- How do I download tag?
  - Head to the releases page, and download the "tag.zip" file. Then unzip it, and drag it into sm64ex-coop (literally).
- Does this support romhacks?
  - Yes, tag supports romhack. It contains a blacklist so that you can remove levels that don't work with it.
- Can I use code contained in this mod for my own mods?
  - Usually yes, credit is not required, just make sure you understand how the code your copying works, and that you aren't just copying massive blobs of code, and I'm fine with it.
- Can I publish custom versions of this mod?
  - If you haven't considered a pull request, then consider that. Otherwise, it's fine so long as it does not contain code taken from newer, unreleased versions of tag, and does not contain code from other mods without credit. I would also like to be in the credits of these mods. I would also hold the right to take any code of the mod and add it to base tag (credit would be added to the creator of said mod). You get to use my code, I get to use yours, fair?
- How can I contribute to the repo?
  - You can fork this repo and make a pull request.
- Where can I report bugs or suggestions?
  - You may report bugs or suggestions in the "Issues" tab.
- How will I know that a update has released?
  - Versions 2.1 and up have an update notifier, however this will only be activated once v37 of coop comes out.
- When do you beta test new versions of Tag?
  - There isn't really a set time. They typically happen when I got a good feature set for a next version. Expect more testing when the next version reaches the R.C stage.
- What are the stages of a new release?
  - Typically it goes thru 2 stages. A beta stage, this is where features are rough, and everything is prone to chage. When I feel comfy with a build, I make that a Release Canidate (R.C.) build. R.C. means that the next version is not too far away, while beta means you still have a ways to go.
